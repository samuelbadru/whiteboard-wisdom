## Does the internet need another blog?

Most definitely not! But I definitely felt I needed to add some variety into my life so here I am. Also I am a chronic extrathinker who's pushing Notion's storage limit to its capacity with how much I write in there. So I thought let's put what I'm already doing out there and if only one person gets some value from it, then I'm more than happy.

I am a strong believer that with 8 billion people on this globe pretty much everything is oversaturated, so that isn't a reason not to do something - especially if it's just a hobby. I like to keep things simple and think small. Yes there are over 600 million blogs out there (woah!) but how many people do I personally know who have one? 0! Now that well may be because I am friend deficient, but point is it's an unsaturated market in my little world üåç

## How did you make your blog?

During my Christmas annual leave I came up with an idea for an app (may discuss in a future post) and this blog. With the latter I was back and forth about whether to just use a Website builder. I decided against it because I realised I wanted to scratch two itches with this blog - writing and coding.

As a new Software Engineer I wanted to put all that I have been learning at work to use for myself. I didn't want to just do a project for the sake of doing one that I will never touch again. I wanted to build something I genuinely would use and was easy enough to do that I wouldn't have an excuse not to. When I saw this [Next.js course](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/create-nextjs-app) that culminated in a blog I knew I had to just go for it as all friction had been removed. I use React but never touched Next.js so thought this would be a great opportunity to get my hands dirty with it. And I'm glad I did because I've learned so much - from SEO, to SSR, to Sblahblah - that I would not have if I went with Wix, WordPress or SquareSpace.

## What will you write about?

I think every life is unique and comes with a plethora of life lessons. I've personally been trying to document these in my Notion that I mentioned earlier. Now I will document these in public. If something applies to you then please feel free to use it and send me a commission!
